Hey all,
 
I finally finished modifying the scripts to run with VTS 2.0.   I am passing the results along for everyone’s use.
 
 
Pre-requisites:
 
1.       LAMP platform (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installed and configured.
2.       CURL installed with TLS 1.2 support.
3.       VTS 2.0 installed and working.  Linux system must have connectivity to the VTS server.
 
 
Instructions:
 
1.       Unzip the contents of the attached ZIP file into your HTML folder (typically /var/www/html)
2.       Edit “config” and “config.php” with the particulars of your installation
3.       Create a database named “vtsdemo” in MySQL (mysqladmin create vtsdemo)
4.       Import the initial demo database.  (mysql < vtsdemo.sql)
5.       Create the following in VTS:
	a.       A text template named “Text”
	b.       A numeric template named “Numeric”.
	c.       Users “custserv1”, “custserv2”, and “fraud” – all with password “vormetric”
	d.       Templates for these users – I use “last 4” for custserv1, “first2, last2” for custserv2, and “first99, last99” for fraud.
6.       Test your setup.  CD to your HTML directory and run the test/demo tokenize and detokenize scripts:
	a.       ./tokenize 1111-2222-3333-4444 custserv1 Numeric
	b.       ./detokenize (token returned in step a) custserv1 Numeric
	c.       ./detokenize (token returned in step a) custserv2 Numeric
	d.       ./detokenize (token returned in step a) fraud Numeric
7.       Try the web demo: Browse to your Centos server and try the demo.   It should (by now) be self-explanatory.

If you have any questions or problems, let me know.

( Below edit from JYP - Aug 2016)

Modified the html to leverage CSS on VTS web UI
Added radio button andd added the following templates in VTS

	Luhn  
	Numbers
	Alpha 
	ASCII

Fixed php so that token values that includes special characters are displayed properly (PHP htmlspecialchars)

Template used in scripts are:

	Luhn-Group_Key1
	Numbers-Group_Key1
	Alpha-Group_Key1
	ASCII-Group_Key1

Group used is Group_Key1

as shown in Joes examples above, testing with the VTS templates I already had configured:
	 ./tokenize 1111-2222-3333-4444 tokeniser Numbers-Group_Key1
	 ./detokenize 2266-5562-8804-2212 finance Numbers-Group_Key1
